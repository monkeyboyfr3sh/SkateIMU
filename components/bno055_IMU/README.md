# BNO055-IMU

This idf-component provides a C Interface for Bosch-Sensortec's BNO055 compatible with Espressif's ESP32 (running esp-idf).
This code allows the esp32 to read vector measurements from the bon055 IMU sensor. If there are any questions or need further functionality
please feel free message me.

# Compatibility

Tested on ESP32-WROOM-32E with BNO055 Adafruit's Breakout Board.

# Supported Interfaces

IÂ²C - fully supported
UART will be supported in the future.

# Getting Started

NOTE: this code is not production ready yet.

find the esp-idf folder and clone this repository

cd <YOUR_ESP-IDF_FOLDER_LOCATION>

git clone https://github.com/christianjc/ESP32_Sensors.git

for more details see examples/

# Wiring

I2C

ADR -> 3v0 (HIGH) -> logic high enables bno055 default address (0x29)

SCL -> SCL (Default: GPIO_NUM_19)

SDA -> SDA (Default: GPIO_NUM_18)
